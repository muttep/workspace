HCL Printers team:
	copy constructure
	Alignment operator (=) overloading

HCL Routers team:
	Interchange nibbles in char veriable (lower nibble to upper vaise versa)
	Single linked list print elements in reverse order with out using any backup or copy. We can use recurssion.
	Difference between binary mutex and semmaphore in linux
	
	struct srt {
		int a;
		char b;
		short int c;
	}
	what is the size of structure ? What is packing and padding. Where the packing will added. For which element packing will be added.

ATOS:
	+ operator overloading
	If we are using friend function, then are we breaking the oops mechanism of data hiding data members ?
	
Capjemini:
	#include <iostream>

	using namespace std;

	class Test {
		int a;
		
	public:
		void show() {
			cout<<"Hello"<<endl;
		}
		
	};

	int main()
	{
		//cout<<"Hello World";
		
		Test *ptr=NULL;
		ptr->show();

		return 0;
	}
	
Philips:
	My own string class. Apply singleton design pattern, with threads and mutexes.
	From the given array with numbers. Print even and odd numbers in separate threads.
	
Altimetrik:
	.Wtite a singleton class with templates
	.Create 2 threads, display alternate number in each threads. Thread1-1, thread2-2, thread1-3, thread1=2-4....

Harman and others:
	. STL's
	. Wtite a template function
	. Difference BW map and Hash
	. Types of smart pointers
	
pathpartnertech :
	1. Bits reverse 
	2. Linked list reverse

Cyient :	
. + operator overloading for strings or char pointers.
. inc c, how free() know how many bytes of memory need to delete ?
. What is the max threads can be supported ? 
	-- It will be depending on the system design.

in.ey:
	Copy numbers to begining of the arr and zeros to end of the array
	int arr[] = {5,6,7,0,0,8,0,9,0,0}	
	difference BW const int *ptr; & int const *ptr;
	Function pointers
